# DOT PATTERNS
After seeing the old age arcade game of Ping-Pong, I tried my hands on making something artistic using the same idea of Pong Ball. Everytime the ball touches the wall, it changes its direction, forming colorful patterns. Looking at these patterns feels satisfying. :D Would be soon trying to make some more algorithmic art!

This was made using p5.js on another lazy day!
